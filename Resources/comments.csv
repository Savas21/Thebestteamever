He executed her call and avoided a smitesteal (avoiding relegation) but then his team died in the baron pit (renegades getting banned). After the fight Hussain was the only surviror so he went to the enemy base (Berlin) where he destroyed the remaining towers (Challenger Series and promotion tournament) thanks to a few minions that were pushing mid (Misfits players), then he finally destroyed the nexus and got out of elo hell (he made it to LCS).",-0.9839,0.696,0.232,0.072,2018-02-23T15:07:41.000Z,Misfits Gaming

I liked your last game against G2. You really improved. I liked Whiteknight and Totoro agressive playstile. Just you mentally collapsed after that baron steal. <br />And sorry but pls can you do the same with Sammux. He plays extremly safe and dont get any opportunity and hesitate too much. I often saw in team fights he just back up from a random support slow etc..  no matter how good you play team fights if there is too low dmg output from your adc.,0.7813,0.591,0.172,0.237,2018-02-12T11:36:04.000Z,Unicorns of Love

He&#39;s always pushing to the limit and calculates everything, and even if sometimes that overpushing doesn&#39;t work at all I think his decisions during games are always justified, he doesn&#39;t seem to do anything randomly. He wants to carry, he looks like a really intelligent and autoexigent person who is always thinking about improve himself, and that&#39;s awesome, but as an autoexigent person I know on my own that it can be an issue sometimes, when I&#39;m too much focussed with that &quot;I have to do it perfect&quot; and I forget I don&#39;t need to go that far. I forget I have my teammates by my side and I don&#39;t have to carry all that pressure by myself.

I won&#39;t fault you for it. :) What I really liked about this video is that you can almost start to see how things work in the team chemistry based on the personalities. Apollo and Solo are really the facilitators. Apollo takes the lead (shot caller, guy asking questions) and Solo tends to pick up the ball whenever Apollo drops it so there weren&#39;t any awkward silences. Hakuho and Lira are quiet and serious. Febiven is a huge troll and everyone loves him, he tends to be the guy who drops the bombs (penta!) and prevents tilt. I&#39;m still a little worried about LirA. Hakuho was quiet, but he seemed engaged. LirA doesn&#39;t seem engaged with the team at all. Do you guys have any psych support yet? Glad to hear coach DLIM brought everyone together so fast.

The way they played the game, strategies, execution, everything was just perfect. Then 2007, emulate (Harts, mSx, Iorek, Rigo, MaT) when they won the WCG over NoA man.. one of the best final of all time, burried in my mind forever. This series was the turning point for me, i plugged in cs for 1st time after that.

1817,26,"TL;DR Epic rocks and Activision does not care about their communities. <br /><br />I agree with the beginning sentiment: the chemistry of this trio while discussing eSports is incredible. Definitely subscribed because of that. First time viewing, but if you&#39;re interested here&#39;s my $0.02. I dont think Call of Duty will ever be as relevant as it once was. I started playing back on CoD4:MW. At that time, like you guys mentioned, the adrenaline of victories was so real. I never minded the adjustments to the game mechanics, because those variations and adjustments kept the newest titles feeling fresh for me. The thing that slayed CoD for me is Activision. Ever since they came up w the model of selling 1/2 a game at the beginning and the other portions separately, those executives have treated the game like a piggy bank rather than an outlet for introverts like myself to really have fun. The amount of involvement and communication between Epic and it&#39;s fans is the life-force of this game. Consistent updates (every 1-2 weeks), constant communication during any sort of server related/random issues, and consistently bringing in new content (mini shields, silenced weapons, chug jugs, guided rockets). Not only are they adding the new content, but so far they have done an incredible job of bringing them in almost 100% balanced. Until Activision cares about their community, they will continue to become less relevant. The other main reason I personally enjoy Fortnite is that the game is not a single-element victory. By this, I mean you can be the best shooter in the world, but if you can&#39;t build there is a chance you will still get slapped.",0.9903,0.832,0.019,0.149,2018-04-03T15:32:23.000Z,OpTic Gaming
