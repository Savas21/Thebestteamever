N√§mlich das so genannte Mouse Abuse. Die Aimo (Die ich selber besitze) ist perfekt im Handling aber f√ºr manche etwas zu gro√ü. Die XTD hatte eine mega gute Beschichtung und auch ein gutes Handling nur die LED Streifen an der Seite st√∂rten einen Gamer sehr.

Die Skeltr ist wirklich eine sehr schicke Tastatur und die second screen-L√∂sung w√ºrde mir sehr gut gefallen, wenn sie denn richtig funktionieren w√ºrde. Nachdem ich die Tastatur angeschlossen habe und die Software installiert habe, verbindet sich mein Samsung Galaxy S7 einwandfrei mit der Skeltr. Das funktioniert dann f√ºr ca. 30 Minuten und danach bricht die Verbindung ab und mein S7 findet keinen Host mehr. Wenn ich die Tastatur dann abstecke und neu installiere funktioniert es wieder, aber das ist ja wohl nicht die L√∂sung. Au√üerdem finde ich keine M√∂glichkeit z.B. &quot;WASD&quot; in anderen Farben leuchten zu lassen. Habt ihr daf√ºr eine L√∂sung? Und wird an einem Update gearbeitet, das die benannten Probleme fixt?

I don&#39;t even watch rest of it. I don&#39;t know why you guys doing it. Look at the top sold mices, everyone recommends zowie mouses to aim better which is very ugly mice but it is not forcing your grip, lets you to grip your own style. (Claw, palm, fingertip, claw/fingertip mixes etc.)<br /><br />Roccat creates very quality amazing texture mices in the market.

I liked your last game against G2. You really improved. I liked Whiteknight and Totoro agressive playstile. Just you mentally collapsed after that baron steal. <br />And sorry but pls can you do the same with Sammux. He plays extremly safe and dont get any opportunity and hesitate too much. I often saw in team fights he just back up from a random support slow etc..  no matter how good you play team fights if there is too low dmg output from your adc.,0.7813,0.591,0.172,0.237,2018-02-12T11:36:04.000Z,Unicorns of Love

He&#39;s always pushing to the limit and calculates everything, and even if sometimes that overpushing doesn&#39;t work at all I think his decisions during games are always justified, he doesn&#39;t seem to do anything randomly. He wants to carry, he looks like a really intelligent and autoexigent person who is always thinking about improve himself, and that&#39;s awesome, but as an autoexigent person I know on my own that it can be an issue sometimes, when I&#39;m too much focussed with that &quot;I have to do it perfect&quot; and I forget I don&#39;t need to go that far. I forget I have my teammates by my side and I don&#39;t have to carry all that pressure by myself.
