### **BACKGROUND** :
In the preseason before 2018, many investors with deep pockets from traditional sports  such as the Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors have bought entire team organizations. 
Before 2018, Some investors (Mark Cuban) expressed hesitation to enter the scene due to the volatility of the sport. In the past, underperforming teams could lose their spot in the league and the investor would lose their entire investment. 
This rule was dropped in 2018 when Riot Games allowed franchising. This makes e-sports investments less risky and attracts more investors.

The Explosive growth of E-sport 
“The League of Legends World Championship reached 60 million unique viewers online, compared to 43 million in 2016” (The Holmes Report). 

#### What makes a League of Legends team valuable?
- Reputation 
- Fans
- Win Rates

For example, Dallas Cowboys is the most valuable Football team in NFL, but it does not play as well as New England Patriots or Philadelphia Eagles. 


### **ASK**:
